NOTE
Please go to the HTML file instead of the RMarkdown because I used maps with the leaflet package similar to project 4.
Note I picked my topic before project 4 was assigned and thought it was unique. 
The index.html file is renamed from my knitted HTML from my Rmarkdown, so that is my final project.
